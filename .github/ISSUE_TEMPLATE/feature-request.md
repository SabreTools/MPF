**Before You Submit**
- Remember to try the [latest WIP build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mnadareski/mpf/build/artifacts) to see if the feature already exists.
- Is it copy protection related? If so, report the issue [here](https://github.com/mnadareski/BurnOutSharp/issues) instead.
- .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5.0 have known limitations, so make sure that what you're asking for isn't already in another build.
- Check [previous issues](https://github.com/SabreTools/MPF/issues) to see if any of those are related to what you're about to ask for.

If none of those apply, then continue...
